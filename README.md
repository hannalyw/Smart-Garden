# Smart-Garden
A project using an Arduino Uno for Automatic Plant Watering System Using Soil Moisture and Light Sensors

# Project Domain
This project falls under the application of embedded systems and IoT in the agricultural sector, focusing on smart farming and automation to improve plant care and resource efficiency.

# Problem Domain
1. Manual watering of plants is time-consuming and often inconsistent, leading to overwatering or underwatering.
2. Lack of awareness about soil moisture levels and sunlight exposure can negatively impact plant health.
3. Traditional irrigation systems waste water and do not adapt to real-time environmental conditions.
4. People with busy schedules or frequent travel may forget to water their plants, causing them to wilt or die.

# Project Goals
1. To develop an automated system that waters plants based on real-time soil moisture readings.
2. To monitor environmental conditions (light levels) to help optimize plant growth.
3. To reduce water wastage by watering only when necessary.
4. To design a cost-effective and scalable smart gardening solution using Arduino Uno.

# Solution Statement
The Smart-Garden system uses an Arduino Uno connected to a soil moisture sensor and a light sensor (LDR). When the moisture level falls below a specified threshold, the Arduino triggers a water pump to irrigate the plant automatically. The light sensor helps monitor sun exposure, which can be used for further plant care enhancements or logging. The system ensures timely watering without human intervention, promoting plant health while conserving water.

# Conclusion
The Smart-Garden project demonstrates a practical implementation of automation in home gardening. By utilizing soil moisture and light sensors with an Arduino Uno, the system ensures optimal watering of plants, improving growth while conserving water. It is a low-cost, user-friendly, and scalable solution suitable for both household and small-scale agricultural use. Future improvements can include wireless monitoring, integration with mobile apps, and data logging for advanced analytics.
